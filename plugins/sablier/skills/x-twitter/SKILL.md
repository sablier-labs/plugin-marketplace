# X/Twitter Posts Skill

Generate X/Twitter posts that represent the Sablier brand—informative, confident, and focused on real value rather
than hype.

## Before Writing

1. **Read** `./references/BRAND_VOICE.md` — understand Sablier's voice
1. **Read** `./references/COMPANY_PROFILE.md` — know our products, metrics, differentiators
1. **Read** `./references/ICP.md` — understand who we're talking to
1. **Fetch docs if needed** — use `https://docs.sablier.com/llms.txt` for product details

## Post Types

### 1. Product Announcement

Announce new features, launches, or updates.

**Structure:**

- Clear statement of what's new
- Why it matters / what you can do with it
- Link to learn more

**Example:**

```text
Sablier is now live on Solana.

Secure lockups and scalable airdrops, wherever your users are.

[link to blog post]
```

**Guidelines:**

- Lead with the news, not "We're excited to announce"
- Focus on user benefit, not feature specs
- One clear CTA

### 2. Educational/Explainer

Explain a concept related to token distribution, vesting, or airdrops.

**Structure:**

- State the concept or problem
- Explain how it works or why it matters
- Connect to Sablier's approach (if relevant)

**Example:**

```text
The problem with traditional airdrops:

→ Recipients dump immediately
→ Short-term interest that fades
→ No long-term community alignment

Vested airdrops fix this. Recipients get tokens over time, creating incentives to stay engaged.

This is why we built Sablier Airdrops.
```

**Guidelines:**

- Provide genuine value even if reader doesn't use Sablier
- Use arrows (→) or dashes (-) for lists
- Don't make every post a pitch

### 3. Social Proof / Metrics

Share data points, customer wins, or milestones.

**Structure:**

- Lead with the number or achievement
- Context on what it means
- Optional: what's next

**Example:**

```text
530,000+ streams created on Sablier.

6+ years of continuous operation, zero hacks.

The leading token distribution infrastructure in web3.
```

**Guidelines:**

- Specific numbers > vague claims
- Let the data speak, minimal commentary
- Don't oversell—confidence comes from track record

### 4. Case Study Highlight

Surface a customer win or use case.

**Structure:**

- Customer + what they did
- Key outcome or benefit
- Link to full case study

**Example:**

```text
TokenSight locked 80% of their token supply in Sablier.

Why? Battle-tested security, great UX, and it's free.

"Our decision was driven by Sablier's capability to seamlessly execute our intricate vesting schedule."

```

**Guidelines:**

- Name the customer (if public)
- Include a quote if available
- Focus on their outcome, not our features

### 5. Comparison / Hot Take

Take a position on a topic in our space.

**Structure:**

- Clear statement of position
- Supporting reasoning
- Don't hedge excessively

**Example:**

```text
Custom vesting contracts are a liability, not an asset.

You're taking on:
- Security risk (unaudited code)
- Maintenance burden
- Opportunity cost (build product, not infra)

Use battle-tested infrastructure. Focus on what makes you unique.
```

**Guidelines:**

- Be opinionated but substantive
- Support claims with reasoning
- Don't attack competitors by name

### 6. Thread (Use Sparingly)

For complex topics that need more depth.

**Structure:**

- Hook in first tweet (must stand alone)
- Each tweet adds one clear point
- End with summary or CTA
- 3-7 tweets typically

**Guidelines:**

- Don't start with "Thread" or "1/"
- Each tweet should make sense individually
- Avoid padding—every tweet must add value
- Use sparingly, prefer single posts

## Writing Rules

### Voice Requirements

- **Confident**: We're the leader—act like it
- **Informative**: Provide value in every post
- **Direct**: Get to the point
- **Professional**: Not corporate-stiff, but not casual either

### Formatting

- Line breaks for readability
- Use → or - for lists, not emoji bullets
- Minimal emoji (avoid rocket/fire energy)
- Links at end, not buried in text

### What Works

- Specific metrics and data
- Clear product benefits
- Educational value
- Customer voices
- Timely commentary on industry topics

### What to Avoid

- "We're excited to announce..."
- Hype words (revolutionary, game-changing, LFG)
- Engagement bait ("RT if you agree")
- Generic crypto speak
- Empty threads that could be one tweet
- Excessive emoji

## Hashtag & Mention Guidelines

- **Hashtags**: Avoid in main tweet text. If needed, add at very end.
- **Mentions**: Tag partners/customers when relevant, but don't overdo it
- **$SABLIER**: We don't have a token, don't imply we do

## Quality Checklist

Before posting:

- [ ] Would this be valuable even if reader never uses Sablier?
- [ ] Is there a specific claim, data point, or insight?
- [ ] Does this sound like Sablier (not generic crypto marketing)?
- [ ] Is it free of hype words and engagement bait?
- [ ] If it's an announcement, is the "what" clear in first sentence?
- [ ] Is formatting clean and readable?
