# Blog Posts

Create blog content that educates, informs, and positions Sablier as the authority on token distribution. All posts
should provide genuine value—not just product pitches.

## Post Types

## Writing Rules

### Structure

- **Use headers liberally**: Make posts scannable
- **Short paragraphs**: 2-4 sentences typically
- **Lists for multiple items**: Easier to scan
- **Callout boxes**: For important notes, tips, warnings

### Voice

- **Confident but not arrogant**: We're the leader, let the data show it
- **Educational**: Help readers understand, not just use
- **Direct**: Get to the point, don't pad
- **Technical but accessible**: Explain jargon, use examples

### Formatting

**Headers:**

```text
# H1 - Post title only
## H2 - Major sections
### H3 - Subsections
```

**Lists:**

- Use bullets for unordered items
- Use numbers for sequential steps
- Each item should be substantive

**Links:**

- Descriptive link text, not "click here"
- Link to docs, app, relevant resources
- External links when they add value

### Length Guidelines

- Announcements: 800-1500 words
- Educational: 1000-2500 words
- Case studies: 600-1000 words
- Technical deep dives: 1500-3000 words

## Proof Points to Include

When relevant, weave in:

- 6+ years without hacks
- 530,000+ streams created
- Major customers (Ethena, Uniswap DAO, Fluid, Maple, Immutable)
- Low, predictable fees
- Multiple audits
- Since 2019

**How to include:**

```text
Good: "Sablier has been running on mainnet since 2019 without any security incidents—a track record that matters when
you're distributing millions in tokens."

Bad: "Sablier is the best and most secure platform!!!"
```

## SEO Considerations

- **Title**: Include primary keyword, be specific
- **Meta description**: Clear value prop, 150-160 chars
- **Headers**: Include relevant keywords naturally
- **Links**: Link to related content, docs

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing:

- [ ] Does the title clearly communicate value?
- [ ] Is there a clear problem/solution or learning outcome?
- [ ] Would this be valuable even without Sablier mentions?
- [ ] Are claims supported with data or examples?
- [ ] Is it scannable (headers, lists, short paragraphs)?
- [ ] Is voice consistent with brand guidelines?
- [ ] Are CTAs clear and appropriate (not pushy)?
- [ ] Are all links working?
- [ ] Is length appropriate for the topic?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Burying the lede**: Put the main point early
1. **Feature lists without benefits**: Always say "so what"
1. **Vague claims**: Use specific numbers and examples
1. **Wall of text**: Break it up with formatting
1. **Hard sell**: Educate first, position product second
1. **Hype language**: Let substance do the work
1. **Forgetting the CTA**: End with clear next steps
