# Writing Skill

Create written content that represents the Sablier brand—informative, confident, and focused on real value rather than
hype. This skill covers blog posts, case studies, and X/Twitter content.

## Before Writing Any Content

Load shared brand references from the plugin's `references/` directory:

1. **Read** (plugin) `references/BRAND_VOICE.md` — Sablier's voice and style
1. **Read** (plugin) `references/COMPANY_PROFILE.md` — products, metrics, positioning
1. **Read** (plugin) `references/ICP.md` — who the audience is
1. **Reference** (plugin) `references/VOICE_EXAMPLES.md` — past content for consistency
1. **Fetch docs if needed** — use `https://docs.sablier.com/llms.txt` for product details

## Content Types

### Blog Posts

For long-form content: product announcements, educational articles, comparisons, technical deep dives.

**Load detailed guidance:** `references/BLOG_POSTS.md`

**Quick reference for post types:**

| Type                 | Length        | Purpose                          |
| -------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Product Announcement | 800-1500w     | Introduce new features/products  |
| Educational          | 1000-2500w    | Teach concepts, best practices   |
| Case Study           | 600-1000w     | Customer success stories         |
| Comparison           | 1000-2000w    | Compare approaches/solutions     |
| Technical Deep Dive  | 1500-3000w    | Developer-focused technical docs |

### Case Studies

For customer success stories documenting how organizations use Sablier.

**Load detailed guidance:** `references/CASE_STUDIES.md`

**Standard structure:**

1. About [Customer] — 2-3 sentences
2. The Challenge — what problem, why it mattered
3. The Solution — why Sablier, how implemented
4. The Results — quantifiable outcomes
5. Customer Quote — direct quote if available
6. Key Takeaway — one actionable insight

### X/Twitter Posts

For social media content: announcements, educational threads, social proof, hot takes.

**Load detailed guidance:** `references/X_TWITTER.md`

**Post type quick reference:**

| Type              | Structure                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Announcement      | News → benefit → link                     |
| Educational       | Problem → explanation → Sablier approach  |
| Social Proof      | Metric → context → positioning            |
| Case Study Teaser | Customer + outcome → quote → link         |
| Hot Take          | Position → reasoning → call to action     |

## Voice Principles

Maintain these across all content:

- **Confident, not arrogant** — Let data and track record speak
- **Educational first** — Provide value even without Sablier
- **Direct** — Get to the point, don't pad
- **Technical but accessible** — Explain jargon, use examples
- **Customer-centric** — Their story, not ours

## Proof Points

Weave in when relevant:

- 6+ years without hacks
- 530,000+ streams created
- Major customers: Ethena, Uniswap DAO, Fluid, Maple, Immutable
- Low, predictable fees
- Multiple audits
- Operating since 2019

**Good example:**

```text
Sablier has been running on mainnet since 2019 without any security incidents—a track record
that matters when you're distributing millions in tokens.
```

**Bad example:**

```text
Sablier is the best and most secure platform!!!
```

## What to Avoid

Across all content:

- "We're excited to announce..." — Lead with the news
- Hype words (revolutionary, game-changing, LFG)
- Vague claims ("great results", "significant improvement")
- Making it about Sablier instead of the reader/customer
- Feature lists without benefits — Always include "so what"
- Wall of text — Use headers, lists, short paragraphs
- Engagement bait ("RT if you agree")
- Excessive emoji

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing any content:

- [ ] Does it provide value even without Sablier mentions?
- [ ] Are claims supported with specific data or examples?
- [ ] Is it scannable (headers, lists, short paragraphs)?
- [ ] Is voice consistent with brand guidelines?
- [ ] Are CTAs clear and appropriate (not pushy)?
- [ ] Does it sound like Sablier, not generic crypto marketing?
