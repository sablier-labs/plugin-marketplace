# Case Studies Skill

Create compelling customer success stories that demonstrate Sablier's value through real-world outcomes. Case studies
should be customer-centric—their story, their challenges, their wins.

## Before Writing

1. **Read** `references/BRAND_VOICE.md` — maintain Sablier's voice
1. **Read** `references/ICP.md` — understand what resonates with prospects
1. **Reference** `references/VOICE_EXAMPLES.md` — past case studies for tone/structure
1. **Fetch docs if needed** — use `https://docs.sablier.com/llms.txt` for product details

## Case Study Structure

[Outcome-focused subtitle, e.g., "Two-year vesting made effortless"]

## About [Customer]

[2-3 sentences on who they are and what they do]

## The Challenge

[What problem they faced]
[Why existing solutions didn't work]
[Stakes—why this mattered]

## The Solution

[Why they chose Sablier]
[How they implemented it]
[Specific details on their setup]

## The Results

[Quantifiable outcomes if available]
[Qualitative benefits]
[What changed for them]

## Customer Quote

## Key Takeaway

[One actionable insight for readers]
```

## Section Guidelines

### About [Customer]

- Keep it brief (2-3 sentences)
- Focus on relevant context (what they do, why token distribution matters to them)
- Don't oversell their company—this is their case study, not their press release

**Example:**

```text
TokenSight is a groundbreaking platform for DEX trading, offering features like trade orders, copy trading, and
real-time alerts. As a new project preparing for token launch, they needed to set up vesting for team, investors,
and early supporters.
```

### The Challenge

- Be specific about the problem
- Explain why it mattered
- Show what they tried or considered

**Key questions to answer:**

- What was broken or painful?
- What were the consequences of not solving it?
- What did they try before?

**Example:**

```text
As TokenSight prepared for their token launch, they faced a complex challenge: managing token vesting for multiple
stakeholder groups with different schedules.

Traditional approaches presented two significant problems:

1. **Time-consuming management**: Custom vesting contracts require continuous oversight and manual intervention.
2. **Security concerns**: Building your own vesting contracts introduces risk, especially without extensive auditing.

With over 80% of their token supply needing to be locked, getting this wrong wasn't an option.
```

### The Solution

- Explain why they chose Sablier specifically
- Include implementation details that help readers understand the approach
- Keep it practical and replicable

**Key questions to answer:**

- Why Sablier over alternatives?
- How did they set it up?
- What specific features did they use?

**Example:**

```text
TokenSight chose Sablier for three key reasons:

1. **Battle-tested security**: Five years of operation without hacks, multiple audits
2. **Flexibility**: Support for complex vesting schedules with cliffs and custom curves
3. **Cost-effective**: Low, predictable fees

They configured their streams as uncancelable, guaranteeing recipients would receive their TKST tokens according to
the schedule—no takebacks possible.
```

### The Results

- Lead with quantifiable outcomes when possible
- Include qualitative benefits
- Be specific, not vague

**Quantifiable outcomes (prefer these):**

- "Locked 80% of token supply"
- "Reduced admin time by X hours/week"
- "Saved $X in custom development"
- "Distributed to 10,000+ recipients"

**Qualitative benefits:**

- "Team can focus on building product, not infrastructure"
- "Recipients have real-time visibility into their vesting"
- "Increased investor confidence"

**Example:**

```text
By using Sablier, TokenSight was able to:

- Lock over **80% of their token supply** securely
- Eliminate ongoing vesting administration
- Provide recipients with real-time access to view their schedules
- Launch with confidence, knowing their vesting was handled by battle-tested infrastructure
```

### Customer Quote

- Get an actual quote if possible
- Should reinforce the key benefit
- Include name and title for credibility

**If no quote available:** Skip this section rather than fabricate one.

**Example:**

```text
> "Sablier enabled us to seamlessly stream our unlocked tokens with a smooth and efficient user experience. Our
> decision was driven by its capability to seamlessly execute our intricate vesting schedule."
> — Blagoj, CEO at TokenSight Corp
```

### Key Takeaway

- One clear, actionable insight
- Should apply beyond just this customer
- Often a lesson others can apply

**Example:**

```text
**Key takeaway**: When over 80% of your token supply needs vesting, don't roll your own solution. Use infrastructure
that's been battle-tested with billions in value locked.
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Voice

- **Customer-centric**: This is their story, not ours
- **Factual**: Stick to what actually happened
- **Confident**: We can be proud of outcomes without being boastful
- **Educational**: Readers should learn something applicable

### Tone

- Professional but not corporate-stiff
- Celebratory of customer success, not of ourselves
- Specific and concrete, not vague

### What to Include

- Specific numbers and metrics
- Direct customer quotes
- Implementation details others can learn from
- Clear before/after contrast

### What to Avoid

- Vague claims ("great results", "significant improvement")
- Making it about Sablier instead of the customer
- Fabricated quotes or metrics
- Overselling or exaggerating outcomes

## Length Guidelines

- **Short case study**: 400-600 words (quick win, simple use case)
- **Standard case study**: 600-1000 words (most cases)
- **Deep dive**: 1000-1500 words (complex implementation, detailed metrics)

Most case studies should be 600-800 words. Readers want the key points quickly.

## Formatting

### Headers

```text
# Main title (company + use case)
## Major sections (Challenge, Solution, Results)
```

### Emphasis

- **Bold** for key metrics and important points
- _Italics_ sparingly for emphasis
- `Code formatting` for technical terms if relevant

### Lists

- Use for multiple benefits, features, or outcomes
- Each item should be substantive (not single words)

## Metadata Template

```text
---
title: "[Customer]: [Use Case Outcome]"
description: "[Brief description for meta/preview]"
customer: "[Customer name]"
use_case: ["vesting", "airdrop", "payroll", "grants"]
products_used: ["Sablier Lockup", "Airstreams", "Flow"]
date: "[Publication date]"

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing:

- [ ] Is the customer's challenge clearly articulated?
- [ ] Do we explain why they chose Sablier specifically?
- [ ] Are there specific, quantifiable outcomes?
- [ ] Is there a customer quote (or good reason for none)?
- [ ] Would a prospect learn something useful?
- [ ] Is it customer-centric, not Sablier-centric?
- [ ] Is the length appropriate (not padded)?
- [ ] Are all facts accurate and approved by customer?

## Examples

### Good Opening

```text
Arcadia, a DeFi protocol on Arbitrum, needed to vest AAA tokens across team members, investors, and liquidity
providers—a two-year commitment involving multiple stakeholder groups with different schedules.

Building custom vesting contracts was never seriously considered. "We wanted to focus on our core product," said
their team. "Infrastructure should be handled by specialists."
```

### Bad Opening

```text
We're thrilled to share an amazing success story! Arcadia is an incredible project and they chose Sablier because
we're the best vesting solution in the market. This is going to be a great case study that shows how awesome
Sablier is!
```

### Good Results Section

```text
Within two weeks of launch, Arcadia had:

- **Vested $2.4M in AAA tokens** across three stakeholder groups
- **Zero administrative overhead** after initial setup
- **100% recipient satisfaction** with the claiming experience

The streams were configured as non-cancelable, giving recipients confidence their allocations were guaranteed.
```

### Bad Results Section

```text
The results were amazing! Everyone loved using Sablier and it worked really well. The team was very happy with the
outcome and would definitely recommend Sablier to others.
```
