### Terms to Avoid

- **Hype words**: revolutionary, game-changing, disruptive, moon, wagmi, ngmi
- **Vague claims**: "best-in-class" without proof, "industry-leading" without data
- **Crypto clichés**: LFG, ser, anon, probably nothing, few understand
- **Corporate speak**: leverage, synergy, utilize, stakeholders, circle back

### Technical Terms Policy

Use precise technical terms but explain them on first use for non-expert audiences.

## Content Patterns

### Openings

**Good:**

- Start with the problem or use case
- Lead with a surprising fact or number
- State what the reader will learn or be able to do

**Avoid:**

- "We're excited to announce..."
- "In this post, we will..."
- "As you may know..."

### Structure by Content Type

| Type          | Pattern                                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blog posts    | Problem → Context → Solution → How it works → Benefits → Next steps |
| Case studies  | Customer context → Challenge → Solution (Sablier) → Results → Quote |
| Announcements | What → Why it matters → How it works → What's next               |
| Educational   | Concept → Why it matters → How it works → Examples → Implications |

### Closings

**Good:**

- Clear call to action (try the product, read docs, contact us)
- Forward-looking statement about what's next
- Reiteration of key benefit

**Avoid:**

- Hard sell pressure
- Generic "follow us on social media"
- Overly effusive sign-offs

## Proof Points

Always include when relevant:

- 5+ years running without hacks
- 125,000+ streams created
- $200M+ average monthly TVL
- Multiple security audits
- Low, predictable fees (~$1-2 per action)
- Senders can cover fees for recipients
- Fully decentralized and immutable
- Major customers: Shapeshift, NounsDAO, VitaDAO, Maple Finance

**How to use**: Specific numbers > vague claims. Let data speak rather than adjectives.

## Brand Personality

**If Sablier were a person**: A senior engineer who's been in the space for years. Knows their stuff deeply. Explains
things clearly without being condescending. Confident but not arrogant. Would rather show you the data than make
claims. Values correctness over hype.

**Relationship with reader**: Expert peer sharing knowledge, not a salesperson or a guru.

## Philosophical Influences

These influence our thinking but don't need to be explicitly referenced in most content:

- **Critical Rationalism** (Popper, Deutsch) — ideas should be tested, we can be wrong
- **Techno-Optimism** — technology solves problems, progress is good
- **First-principles thinking** — understand fundamentals before building

**How they manifest:**

- Willingness to explain our reasoning
- Acknowledging trade-offs and limitations
- Focus on solving real problems
- Educational approach to content

## Voice Examples

### Good Examples

**Explaining a product benefit:**

> "Recipients can withdraw funds the second they are distributed, ensuring a great user experience."

_Why it works: Direct, benefit-focused, specific_

**Establishing credibility:**

> "Sablier is a fully decentralized protocol that has been running on Mainnet since 2019 without any hacks, with a
> median monthly TVL of $152M between 2021 and 2023."

_Why it works: Specific numbers, factual, lets data speak_

**Explaining a problem:**

> "The big problem with simple, one-time airdrops is that they don't create the right incentives for community members.
> They don't incentivize long-term thinking."

_Why it works: Clear problem statement, explains why it matters_

### Bad Examples

> "Sablier is revolutionizing the way tokens are distributed with our game-changing technology!"

_Why it fails: Hype words, vague, no substance_

> "We're super excited to announce this amazing new feature that's going to change everything!"

_Why it fails: Overly enthusiastic, vague, no information_

## Consistency Guidelines

- **Across authors**: All team members should sound like Sablier, not like individuals
- **Across channels**: Same voice fundamentals on Twitter, blog, docs—adapted for format
- **Over time**: Reference past content to maintain consistency with established patterns
