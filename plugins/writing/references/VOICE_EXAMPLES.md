## Voice Examples (From Actual Posts)

### Product Announcement Opening (Airstreams)

> Airstreams. Sounds cool, doesn't it? In this blog post, we're excited to unveil the innovative mechanism we've
> meticulously crafted for the past six months. We'll dive into how it works and the unique advantages it brings to the
> table.
>
> Before starting, and to make things extra clear about how awesome Airstreams is as a product, note that it's entirely
> free to use. Zero fees besides gas costs.

_Why it works: Conversational opening, immediately addresses pricing, sets up what's coming._

### Problem Statement (Traditional Airdrops)

> The big problem with simple, one-time airdrops is that they don't create the right incentives for community members.
> They don't incentivize long-term thinking.
>
> This is a major problem because community members are the backbone of a crypto project, and losing most of them
> immediately after the airdrop isn't great.

_Why it works: Clear problem, explains why it matters, conversational._

### Explaining a Solution (Airstreams)

> The solution to this problem is extremely elegant and creates the right incentives for community members to think
> from a long-term perspective. It will guarantee that the community will keep the project's future as their first and
> foremost priority.
>
> That solution is called Airstreams.

_Why it works: Builds anticipation, makes the connection to benefits clear._

### Customer Quote Integration (TokenSight)

> "Sablier enabled us to seamlessly stream our unlocked tokens with a smooth and efficient user experience. Moreover,
> its implementation proved to be remarkably cost-effective, significantly more economical than competing options. Our
> decision to opt for Sablier was driven by its capability to seamlessly execute our intricate vesting schedule."
> — Blagoj, CEO at TokenSight Corp

### Benefits Framing (Airstreams)

> There are two main advantages to having a vested airdrop:
>
> 1. Prevents dumping on day 1, given the tokens are vested and gradually unlocked.
> 2. Ensures community alignment, as recipients know they will still be receiving tokens X months/years from now,
>    meaning they have an incentive to stay involved in the project.

_Why it works: Clear numbered benefits, explains the "why" for each._

### Technical Explanation (How Airstreams Work)

> Creating a campaign with lots of recipients won't ruin you in terms of gas fees. Launching a campaign means deploying
> a smart contract with a constant-size Merkle proof associated with your user data. The streams are created only when
> each recipient claims the streams.

_Why it works: Technical accuracy, addresses a real concern (gas costs), clear explanation._

### Closing CTA Pattern

> If you are launching a new token, use Sablier Airstreams.
>
> Want to get started? Check out the user interface here.
> Want a demo? Fill out this form, and we will reach out to you.

_Why it works: Direct recommendation, multiple CTAs for different intents._

## Recurring Themes

1. **"Low, predictable fees"** — Transparent pricing, senders can cover for recipients
2. **"Battle-tested"** — Security track record (5+ years, no hacks)
3. **"Set and forget"** — Automation benefit
4. **"Long-term alignment"** — Community incentive benefit
5. **"Prevent dumping"** — Airdrop-specific benefit
6. **"Day 1"** — Common reference point for airdrop problems

**Historical note**: "Free to use" was a key theme until February 2025 pricing changes. Older posts reference
this—new content should use current pricing messaging.
